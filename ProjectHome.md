Graphs consist of nodes joined by edges.  Nodes have data, and edges have weights.  There are a many operations that make a graph, their performance varies with implementation.  Many problems can be expressed in terms of graphs, among them is cluster analysis.  In cluster analysis items are grouped by similarity.  The FastGraph implementation presented here works well for cluster analysis.
